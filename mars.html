    <p style="color: white;">Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965. NASA's Viking 1 lander transmitted the first images from the Martian surface in 1976. Two countries have successfully deployed rovers on Mars, the United States first doing so with Sojourner in 1997 and China with Zhurong in 2021.[26] There are also planned future missions to Mars, such as a NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return set to happen in 2026, and the Rosalind Franklin rover mission, which was intended to launch in 2018 but was delayed to 2024 at the earliest, with a more likely launch date at 2028.

        Mars can be viewed from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. This appearance, due to the iron oxide prevalent on its surface, has led to Mars often being called the Red Planet.[27][28] It is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude that reaches âˆ’2.94, comparable to that of Jupiter and surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[16] Mars has been observed since ancient times. Over the millennia it has been featured in culture and the arts in ways that have reflected humanity's growing knowledge of it.</p>
